# ExpandableTableView

An expandable tableview is a tableview that “allows” its cells to expand and collapse, showing and hiding that way other cells that in any other case would be always visible. Creating expandable table views is a better alternative when it's required to gather simple data, or to display on-demand information to users.

# App Features

You can allow expanding single or multiple cell based on your requirements.
